**Prompt:**

Analyze and fix security vulnerabilities in a Java application by identifying CVEs and applying recommended patches.

## Analysis Phase

1. **Vulnerability Scanning**
   - Review dependency-check reports
   - Identify all CVEs affecting the application
   - Categorize by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
   - List affected dependencies and versions

2. **Impact Assessment**
   - Determine which vulnerabilities affect your code paths
   - Assess potential exploit scenarios
   - Evaluate business impact of each vulnerability

## Remediation Steps

3. **Dependency Updates**
   - Update vulnerable dependencies to patched versions
   - Check for breaking changes in new versions
   - Verify compatibility with existing code
   - Update transitive dependencies if needed

4. **Code Changes**
   - Replace deprecated or vulnerable API usage
   - Apply security best practices
   - Add input validation and sanitization
   - Implement secure coding patterns

5. **Verification**
   - Re-run security scans
   - Run all tests to ensure no regressions
   - Verify application functionality
   - Document all changes made

## Key Considerations

- **Version Compatibility**: Ensure updated dependencies don't break functionality
- **Test Coverage**: Run comprehensive tests after updates
- **Documentation**: Keep track of all CVE fixes
- **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for future vulnerabilities

## Output Format

Provide:
- CVE analysis report with severity ratings
- Dependency update recommendations
- Code changes required (with file paths)
- Testing checklist
- Risk assessment for each vulnerability
- Remediation verification steps
